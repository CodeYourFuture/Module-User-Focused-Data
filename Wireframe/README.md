The page should NOT use any framework like Bootstrap.

## Learning Objectives

- Use the :first-child pseudo-class to style the first article so that it stands out from the others
- Use version control by committing often and pushing regularly to GitHub
- Don't use any frameworks; write your own layout using HTML and CSS
