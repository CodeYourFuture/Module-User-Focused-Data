![Wireframe](./wireframe.png)

Using the provided wireframe, create a new webpage explaining:

1. What is Git?
2. Why do developers need Git?

## Learning Objectives

- Apply a consistent color scheme to links and text on the webpage
- Use semantic HTML tags to structure the webpage
- Create a page header with a title and description
- Create an articles section with three articles, each including a title, summary, and a link
- Create a page footer and fix it to the bottom of the viewport
- Use the :first-child pseudo-class to style the first article so that it stands out from the others
- Use version control by committing often and pushing regularly to GitHub
- Don't use any frameworks; write your own layout using HTML and CSS

Use the wireframe sketch provided to lay out the page. Please note that this is just a sketch - you can choose the colors, fonts, and images that you want to use on the page.
