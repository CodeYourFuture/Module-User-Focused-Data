          <h2>What is Git?</h2>
          <p>Git is a system that helps developers track changes in code. It allows teams to work together on the same project without losing any information or overwriting changes. Git is important for keeping the code organized.</p>

          <P>Git is a version control system. It helps developers keep track of changes made to code over time. This means that when developers write code, they can go back to an earlier version if something goes wrong. Git is especially useful for teams, as it lets many people work on the same project without causing conflicts or losing changes.

          Git is a distributed system, meaning each developer has a copy of the whole project on their own computer. They can make changes, test them, and later share those changes with others. Git keeps the project history safe and helps developers avoid mistakes by allowing them to see what changes were made, who made them, and when.
            
          Git is widely used in software development because it makes collaboration easy and helps manage large projects.

            <h2>Why do developers need Git?</h2>
            <p>Developers need Git to work together on the same project, keep track of code changes, and make sure they don’t lose any work. Git helps with collaboration, organization, and fixing mistakes.</p>

            <p>Git is important for developers because it helps them work together. With Git, multiple developers can make changes to the same project without overwriting each other’s work. Git tracks every change, so developers can always see what has been updated or go back to an earlier version if needed.

            Git also allows developers to create branches. This means that they can work on new features or fix bugs separately from the main project. Once their work is ready, they can merge their changes back into the main project without affecting others.
              
            Git also acts as a backup system, because each developer has a full copy of the project. If something goes wrong, it’s easy to recover the code. Git improves teamwork, code organization, and makes it easier to fix mistakes.</p>

            <h2>What is a branch in Git?</h2>
            <p>A branch in Git is a separate version of the project where developers can work on new features or fixes without changing the main code. Branches help keep the project organized and allow many tasks to be done at the same time.</p>
            <button>Read more</button>
            <p>In Git, a branch is like a separate path of the project. It allows developers to work on something new or test changes without affecting the main version of the code. Each branch keeps its own history of changes, so developers can make as many updates as needed.

            Most projects have a main branch (often called "main" or "master"). This is where the final, stable code lives. Developers create new branches for each feature or bug fix. When their work is done and tested, the branch can be merged back into the main branch.
              
            Branches are useful because they let many developers work on different parts of a project at the same time. This makes it easier to manage projects, especially large ones.</p>
