    <h1>GIT Control Versions</h1>
    <p>
      Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very
      large projects with speed and efficiency.

      <h2>What is Git</h2>
      <p class="overlay">
        By far, the most widely used modern version control system in the world today is Git. Git is a mature, actively
        maintained open source project originally developed in 2005 by Linus Torvalds, the famous creator of the Linux
        operating system kernel.</p>

      <p class="overlay">
        A staggering number of software projects rely on Git for version control, including commercial projects as well
        as open source. Developers who have worked with Git are well represented in the pool of available software
        development talent and it works well on a wide range of operating systems and IDEs (Integrated Development
        Environments).</p>
      <p class="overlay">
        Having a distributed architecture, Git is an example of a DVCS (hence Distributed Version Control System).
        Rather than have only one single place for the full version history of the software as is common in once-popular
        version control systems like CVS or Subversion (also known as SVN), in Git, every developer's working copy of
        the code is also a repository that can contain the full history of all changes.

        <h2>Why do developers need Git?</h2>
        <p class="overlay">
          Developers need Git because it is a vital tool for version control that facilitates efficient collaboration,
          organization, and management of code. As software projects become more complex, keeping track of changes and
          coordinating work among multiple team members becomes challenging. Git addresses these issues by allowing
          developers to create branches for their work, enabling them to make changes independently without affecting
          the main codebase. This branching strategy helps avoid conflicts and allows for experimentation with new
          features.
        </p>
        <p class="overlay">
          One of the significant advantages of Git is its ability to track changes over time. Each modification made to
          the code is recorded in a commit, which includes a message describing the change. This history enables
          developers to understand the evolution of the project and makes it easy to identify when and why specific
          changes were made. If a bug is introduced, Git allows for quick reversion to a previous state, minimizing
          disruption.

        <h2>What is a branch in Git?</h2>
        <p class="overlay">
          In Git, a branch is a separate line of development that allows developers to work on different features, bug
          fixes, or experiments independently from the main codebase. This isolation enables parallel development,
          letting multiple developers create branches for their tasks without affecting one anotherâ€™s progress. Each
          branch maintains its own commit history, making it easy to track changes specific to that branch while keeping
          the main branch stable. This structure enhances efficiency, especially in collaborative environments where
          teams can simultaneously develop new features.
        </p>
        <p class="overlay">
          Once development on a branch is complete, it can be merged back into the main branch. Git offers robust
          merging tools that facilitate combining changes while addressing any conflicts that arise from simultaneous
          modifications. This ensures cohesive project evolution, integrating contributions from various developers.
          Branching strategies, such as feature branching and hotfix branches, further streamline development by
          organizing work clearly. Overall, branches are crucial for effective version control, enabling teams to
          innovate while preserving code integrity.
