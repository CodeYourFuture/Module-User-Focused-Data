        <h2>What is Git?</h2>
        <p>
          Git is a free and open source distributed version control system
          designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with
          speed and efficiency. Git is easy to learn and has a tiny footprint
          with lightning fast performance. It outclasses SCM tools like
          Subversion, CVS, Perforce, and ClearCase with features like cheap
          local branching, convenient staging areas, and multiple workflows.

          <h2>Why do Developers need Git?</h2>
          <p>
            Git is all about efficiency. For developers, it eliminates
            everything from the time wasted passing commits over a network
            connection to the man hours required to integrate changes in a
            centralized version control system. It even makes better use of
            junior developers by giving them a safe environment to work in.

          <h2>What is a branch in Git?</h2>
          <p>
            Git branches are effectively a pointer to a snapshot of your
            changes. When you want to add a new feature or fix a bug—no matter
            how big or how small—you spawn a new branch to encapsulate your
            changes.
