            Git is a version control system that helps you manage changes to files in a project, especially when working with code. Here's a quick summary:
            <ol>
              <li><B>Version Control: </B>It keeps track of changes to files over time.</li>
              <li><b>Snapshots: </b>You can compare versions of your files to find out what changes have been made.</li>
              <li><b>Collaboration: </b>If you are working with a team, you can create new branches to work on different features or bug fixes without affecting the main codebase.</li>
            </ol>
          </p>

              Why do developers need Git?
            </h3>
            <p>
              Git is essential for:
              <ol>
                <li><b>Collaboration: </b>When working with a team, Git allows you to share your code with others, review changes, and merge them back into the main codebase.</li>
                <li><b>Version Control: </b>It helps you keep track of changes to your files, so you can revert to a previous version if needed.</li>
                <li><b>Backup: </b>Git creates a copy of your files and their history, so you can easily restore your project to a previous state if needed.</li>
                <li><b>Continuous Integration: </b>Git can help automate the process of building, testing, and deploying your project, making it easier to collaborate and maintain.</li>
              </ol>

            <p>
              A branch in Git is a copy of your project that you can work on without affecting the main codebase. When you create a branch, you can experiment with new features, fix bugs, or make changes without affecting the rest of your project. Here's how to create a branch in Git:
              <ol>
                <li>Open your terminal or command prompt.</li>
                <li>Navigate to the directory where your project files are located.</li>
                <li>Run the following command to create a new branch: <code>git branch branch-name</code></li>
                <li>Replace <code>branch-name</code> with the name you want to give your branch.</li>
                <li>Run the following command to switch to the new branch: <code>git checkout branch-name</code></li>
              </ol>
            </p>
