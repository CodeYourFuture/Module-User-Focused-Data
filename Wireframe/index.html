          <h2>what is git?</h2>
          <p>Git is a version control system that helps developers track changes in code, collaborate easily, and manage project versions. It allows branching, committing changes, and reverting to earlier versions. Popular platforms like GitHub use Git for smooth teamwork on coding projects.</p>

          <h2>why do developers need Git?</h2>
          <p>Developers need Git to manage code efficiently, especially in teams. It tracks changes, preventing code conflicts when multiple people work on the same files. Git also allows developers to experiment with new features in branches, merge them later, and easily roll back mistakes. It ensures smooth collaboration and keeps a detailed history of project development.</p>

          <h2>what is a branch in Git?</h2>
          <p>A branch in Git is a separate line of development that allows you to work on different features or fixes without affecting the main codebase. You can create a branch to isolate your changes, and once you’re done, merge it back into the main branch (often called “main” or “master”). This helps manage parallel WorkStreams and keeps the code organized and stable.</p>
