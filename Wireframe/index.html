          <h4>What is Git?</h4>
          <p>Git is a distributed version control system that helps developers track changes in their code over time. It allows multiple people to collaborate on the same project without overwriting each other’s work. Git stores a history of changes and enables the user to revert to earlier versions if necessary.</p>
