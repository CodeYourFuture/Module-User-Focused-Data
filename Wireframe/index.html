              <p>
    
    Git is a distributed version control system designed to track changes in files and facilitate collaboration among multiple developers. Here are some key features of Git:
    
    
    <ol class=ol-li>
      <li> Version Control: Git records changes to files over time, allowing users to revert to previous versions if needed.
    
      </li>
      <li>
        Distributed System: Unlike centralized version control systems, every developer has a complete copy of the repository, including its history, on their local machine. This enables offline work and enhances collaboration.
    
      </li>
    <li>
      Branching and Merging: Git allows users to create branches for experimentation without affecting the main codebase. Branches can be merged back into the main branch when changes are ready.
    
    </li>
    <li>
      Collaboration: Multiple developers can work on the same project simultaneously. Git handles conflicts that may arise from concurrent changes, allowing for smoother teamwork.
    
    </li>
    </ol>

                <P>
                  Developers use Git because it's a free and open-source version control system that helps with source code management, collaboration, and efficiency

                  Git branches are effectively a pointer to a snapshot of your changes. When you want to add a new feature or fix a bug—no matter how big or how small—you spawn a new branch to encapsulate your changes.
