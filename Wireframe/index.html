    <h2>Why do developers need git?</h2>
    <p>Developers use git to handle large and small projects more efficiently track changes in the source code</p>
    <h2>What is branch in git?</h2>
    <p>Branches are for experimentation to try out difference styles with different branch names. E.g. try-purple or try-blue to experiment different colour themes. They may share some commonality in history and content but may vary in others.</p>
