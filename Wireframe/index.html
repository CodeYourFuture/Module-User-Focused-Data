        <p>Git is a tool that helps you track changes to files, especially when you're working on code. Think of it like a super-powered "undo" button that lets you go back to any point in your projectâ€™s history. Itâ€™s also great for working with others because it lets everyone make changes at the same time without overwriting each other's work. Git is widely used by developers to manage code, but it can be used for any project where you need to keep track of changes.</p>
        <p>By far, the most widely used modern version control system in the world today is Git. Git is a mature, actively maintained open source project originally developed in 2005 by Linus Torvalds, the famous creator of the Linux operating system kernel.

        <p>FGit branches are effectively a pointer to a snapshot of your changes. When you want to add a new feature or fix a bugâ€”no matter how big or how smallâ€”you spawn a new branch to encapsulate your changes. T</p>
