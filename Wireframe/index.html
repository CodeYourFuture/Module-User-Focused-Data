          <h2>Why developers use git?</h2>
          Developers use Git, for a number of reasons, including: 
<span>Collaboration</span>
Git allows multiple developers to work on the same project at the same time without overwriting each other's changes. 
Version control
Git tracks changes to source code over time, so developers can revert to specific versions if needed. 
<span>Backups</span>
Git stores a complete history of all changes made to code, which can be helpful if data is lost or corrupted. 
Distributed architecture
Git's distributed architecture allows developers to store project source code and track changes more efficiently. 
Merging
Git allows developers to merge changes made by multiple people into a single file.

          <h3>Master branch</h3>
          The default branch name in Git is master . As you start making commits, you're given a master branch that points to the last commit you made.Every time you commit, the master branch pointer moves forward automatically. The “master” branch in Git is not a special branch.

          <h3>New branch</h3>
          The git branch command can be used to create a new branch. When you want to start a new feature, you create a new branch off main using git branch new_branch . Once created you can then use git checkout new_branch to switch to that branch.
