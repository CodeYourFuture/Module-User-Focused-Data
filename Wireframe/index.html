      <h1>What is Git?</h1>
      <p>
          Git is a distributed version control system that allows developers to
          track changes in their code and collaborate on projects efficiently.
          It enables multiple contributors to work on the same project
          simultaneously while keeping a complete history of changes, making it
          easy to revert to previous versions if needed.

      <p class="article-summary">
          Git supports branching and merging, allowing developers to experiment
          with new features without affecting the main codebase. Its
          decentralized nature means that every contributor has a full copy of
          the repository, enhancing collaboration and minimizing the risk of
          data loss.

        <p class="article-summary"> In Git, a branch is a new/separate version of the main repository also,In Git, a branch is essentially a pointer to a specific snapshot (commit) of your project. It allows you to work on different versions or features of a project simultaneously without affecting the main codebaseA branch is essentially a lightweight movable pointer to one of the commits.</p>
