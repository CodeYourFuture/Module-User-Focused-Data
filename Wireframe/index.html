            <h2>Why do developers need Git?</h2>
             <ul><li>Tracking Changes: Git allows you to track every change made to your codebase</li>
              <li>Collaboration: Git enables multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously</li>
              <li>Open Source and Collaboration: Git is widely used in open-source projects, making it the standard for collaborative development</li>
              <li>Rollback and Recovery: If you introduce a bug or make a mistake, Git lets you easily revert to previous working versions of your code, ensuring you can recover from errors quickly.</li>
             </ul>

            <h3>What is a branch in Git?</h3> 
            <p>In Git, a branch is essentially a pointer to a specific commit in your project's history. 
              <br>Think of it like a bookmark that lets you jump back to a particular point in time where your code was in a specific state.</br></p>
