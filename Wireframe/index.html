        <h1>A Comprehensive Guide to Version Control</h1>
        <p>
          Git is easy to learn and has a tiny footprint with lightning fast
          performance. It outclasses SCM tools like Subversion, CVS, Perforce,
          and ClearCase with features like cheap local branching, convenient
          staging areas, and multiple workflows.

            <h2>What is Git?</h2>
            <p>
              Git is a free and open source distributed version control system
              designed to handle everything from small to very large projects
              with speed and efficiency.

            <h2>Why do developers need Git?</h2>
            <p>
              All developers will use some kind of version control system (VCS),
              a tool to allow them to collaborate with other developers on a
              project without the danger of them overwriting each other's work,
              and roll back to previous versions of the code base if a problem
              is discovered later on. The most popular VCS (at least among web
              developers) is Git, along with GitHub, a site that provides
              hosting for your repositories and several tools for working with
              them. This module aims to teach you what you need to know about
              both of them.It is rare that you will work on a project completely
              on your own, and as soon as you start working with other people
              you start to run the risk of conflicting with each other's work —
              this is when both of you try to update the same piece of code at
              the same time. You need to have some kind of mechanism in place to
              manage the occurrences, and help avoid loss of work as a result.

            <h2>What is a branch in Git?</h2>
            <p>
              The Git feature that really makes it stand apart from nearly every
              other SCM out there is its branching model. Git allows and
              encourages you to have multiple local branches that can be
              entirely independent of each other. The creation, merging, and
              deletion of those lines of development takes seconds. This means
              that you can do things like: Frictionless Context Switching.
              Create a branch to try out an idea, commit a few times, switch
              back to where you branched from, apply a patch, switch back to
              where you are experimenting, and merge it in. Role-Based
              Codelines. Have a branch that always contains only what goes to
              production, another that you merge work into for testing, and
              several smaller ones for day to day work. Feature Based Workflow.
              Create new branches for each new feature you're working on so you
              can seamlessly switch back and forth between them, then delete
              each branch when that feature gets merged into your main line.
              Disposable Experimentation. Create a branch to experiment in,
              realize it's not going to work, and just delete it - abandoning
              the work—with nobody else ever seeing it (even if you've pushed
              other branches in the meantime).
