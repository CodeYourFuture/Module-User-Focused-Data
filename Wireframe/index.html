      <h3>What Is Git ?</h3>
      <h3>Git is a version control system that tracks changes to files over time. It's a powerful tool that allows developers to collaborate effectively, manage different versions of their projects, and revert to previous states if necessary.</h3>

      <h3>Why developers need Git:</h3>
      <h3>
        Version control: Git helps developers track changes to their code over time, making it easy to revert to previous versions if needed.
        Collaboration: Git allows multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously, merging their changes and resolving conflicts.
        Experimentation: Developers can create branches to experiment with new features or bug fixes without affecting the main codebase.

      <h3>What is a branch in Git?</h3>
      <h3>A branch in Git is like a parallel version of a repository. It allows you to work on different features or bug fixes independently without affecting the main codebase. Think of it as creating a separate workspace where you can experiment and make changes without risking the stability of the main project.</h3>
