          Git is a modern version control system that is open source. It is able

          the repository during different versions of the project.

          <h1>Why do developers need Git?</h1>
        </header>
        <p>
          Developers can create repositories with branches, commits and code.

          <h1>What is a branch in Git?</h1>
        </header>
        <p>
          Git branches provide snapshots of changes made to your code, pointing
          to commits. They can be used for small or large features you want to
          introduce to your code. The local or remote branches can eventually be
          merged to the main branch, once you are happy with the features
          created.
