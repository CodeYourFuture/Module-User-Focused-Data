    <h2 class="article-block_title">What is Git?</h2>
    <div class="article-block_description">Git is a distributed version control system designed to help developers manage changes to source code during software development. Created by Linus Torvalds in 2005, Git enables teams to track revisions, collaborate on projects, and maintain a history of modifications. Unlike centralized version control systems, Git allows each developer to have a complete local copy of the entire repository, making it fast and efficient. With features like branching, merging, and conflict resolution, Git provides developers with powerful tools to enhance productivity and ensure code integrity throughout the development lifecycle.</div>

    <h2 class="article-block_title">Why do developers need Git?</h2>
    <div class="article-block_description">Developers need Git for several compelling reasons. First and foremost, Git enhances collaboration by allowing multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously without interfering with each other's code. It also maintains a comprehensive history of changes, making it easy to track and revert to previous versions when necessary. Additionally, Git facilitates code review and quality assurance processes through features like branching and pull requests. By using Git, developers can streamline their workflows, reduce the risk of errors, and improve overall project management, ultimately leading to more efficient and successful software development.</div>

    <h2 class="article-block_title">What is a branch in Git?</h2>
    <div class="article-block_description">A branch in Git is a parallel version of the repository that allows developers to work on features or fixes independently from the main codebase, typically referred to as the "main" or "master" branch. Branching enables developers to isolate their work, experiment with new ideas, and collaborate without affecting the stability of the main project. Once the work on a branch is complete, it can be merged back into the main branch, integrating the changes into the primary codebase. This powerful feature of Git fosters a more organized development process, encouraging innovation while maintaining a clean and stable project history.</div>
