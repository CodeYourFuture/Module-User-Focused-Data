        <h2>What is Git?</h2>
        <p>Git is a tool that helps you track changes to files, especially when you're working on code.

        <h2>What is a branch in Git?</h2>
        <p>FGit branches are effectively a pointer to a snapshot of your changes. When you want to add a new feature or fix a bugâ€”no matter how big or how smallâ€”you spawn a new branch to encapsulate your changes. T</p>
