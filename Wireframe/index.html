        <h2>Why do developers need Git?</h2>
        <p>Developers need Git for several reasons:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Collaboration</li>
          <li>Backup</li>
          <li>Code Management</li>
          <li>Accountability</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What is a branch in Git?</h2>
        <p>In GitHub, a branch is an independent line of development within a repository. Branches allow developers to work on features, bug fixes, or experiments in isolation from the main codebase (often called the "main" or "master" branch). This means you can make changes without affecting the stable version of your project.</p>
