              Git is a powerful version control system that helps developers
              manage and track changes in their code. It was created by Linus
              Torvalds in 2005 to support the development of the Linux kernel.
              Unlike traditional version control systems, Git is distributed,
              meaning that every developer has a complete copy of the entire
              repository, including its history, on their local machine.

                One of the biggest advantages of Git is its branching
                capabilities. Git branches are cheap and easy to merge. Feature
                branches provide an isolated environment for every change to your
                codebase.

                Git branches are effectively a pointer to a snapshot of code
                changes. When you want to add a new feature or fix a bug—no matter
                how big or how small—you spawn a new branch to encapsulate your
                changes.
