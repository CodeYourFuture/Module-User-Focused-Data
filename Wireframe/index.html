      <p class="responsive-text">Git is a tool that helps people track and manage changes to files over time, like keeping a history of edits. It’s often used for coding projects, but can be applied to any type of files. Imagine working on a document and being able to go back to an earlier version, see who made changes, or work with others on the same project without accidentally overwriting each other’s work. Git helps with this by creating "snapshots" of the files at different stages, so changes are easy to manage and keep organised.</p>

            <h4>Benefits of version control</h4>
            <p>Git is an important tool for version control because it allows users to efficiently track and manage changes in a project, whether working individually or in teams. It enables users to revert to earlier versions if needed and view the history of changes. Git's branching and merging features also make it easy for multiple collaborators to work on different parts of a project simultaneously without conflicts, making it essential for managing complex projects and ensuring smooth collaboration.</p>

            <h4>The collaborative power of the developer community</h4>
            <p>Git allows developers to create separate "branches" to work on different features or fixes independently. These branches can then be merged back into the main project when ready, avoiding conflicts or overwritten code. With Git, developers can easily review, share, and collaborate on code in real time, track each other’s contributions, and resolve issues through pull requests. This streamlines collaboration, boosts productivity, and ensures code quality across teams.</p>
