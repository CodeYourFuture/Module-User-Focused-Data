      <h2>What is GitHub</h2>
      <p>GitHub is an online software development platform. It's used for storing, tracking, and collaborating on software projects.</p>
      <br>
      <p>It makes it easy for developers to share code files and collaborate with fellow developers on open-source projects. GitHub also serves as a social networking site where developers can openly network, collaborate, and pitch their work.</p>
      <br>
      <p>GitHub allows software developers and engineers to create remote, public-facing repositories on the cloud for free. A repository, or "repo" for short, is a coding project’s files and the revision history for each file.
        Once you’ve set up a repository on GitHub, you can copy it to your device, add and modify files locally, then "push" your changes back to the repository where your changes display for the public.</p>
