          <h2>What is Git?</h2>
          <p>
            Git is a widely-used version control system that helps developers track changes in their code. 
            It allows teams to collaborate on projects, maintain a history of changes,
            and revert back to previous versions if necessary. Git is known for its speed,
            efficiency, and flexibility in handling projects of any size.

            <h2>Why do Developers need Git?</h2>
            <p>
              Developers rely on Git to efficiently manage and track changes in their codebase. 
              Git provides a seamless way to collaborate on projects, allowing multiple developers 
              to work on the same project without overwriting each otherâ€™s work. Its branching and 
              merging features enable developers to experiment with new ideas and features without
              disrupting the main codebase. With Git, teams can maintain a complete history of changes,
              making it easier to revert to previous versions if issues arise. This level of control 
              and flexibility makes Git an essential tool for modern software development.

            <h2>What is a branch in Git?</h2>
            <p>
              A branch in Git allows developers to create an independent line of development.
              By branching, you can work on new features, bug fixes, or experiments without
              affecting the main codebase. Each branch represents a separate version of the project, 
              which can later be merged back into the main branch when the changes are complete and
              approved.
