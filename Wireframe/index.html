            <h2>What is Git?</h2>
            <p>Git is a version control system; you can think of it as a series of snapshots (commits) of your code base. With the creation of each snapshot you built out a whole application, seeing the growth of a full app. During this time you can make branches
              to experiment and come back to a previous snapshot you took or merge those experiments into your app.</p>
            <h2>What is GitHub?</h2>
            <p>GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere using those code snapshots that you took during development.</p>

                or even update our code base with feature they wanted to add.</p>
