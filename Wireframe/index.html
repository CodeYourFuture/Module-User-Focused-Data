           <h2>Wat is a branch in Git?</h2>
           <p>In Git, a branch is an independent copy of the source code that allows developers to work on new features, bug fixes, or experiments without affecting the main codebase, known as "main" or "master." Branches facilitate collaboration and parallelism, enabling multiple developers to work simultaneously on different projects. In this article, we will explore the concept of branches in Git, how to use them, and why they are essential for an efficient workflow in software development.</p>
