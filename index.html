                <p>Git basically takes a picture of what all your files look like at that moment and stores a reference to that snapshot.</p>

                <h2>Why do developers need Git?</h2>
                <p>Git is the most commonly used version control system. Git tracks the changes you make to files, so you have a record of what has been done, and you can revert to specific versions should you ever need to.</p>

                <h2>What is a branch in Git?</h2>
                <p>A branch in Git is simply a lightweight movable pointer to one of these commits. The default branch name in Git is master. As you start making commits, you're given a master branch that points to the last commit you made. Every time you commit, the master branch pointer moves forward automatically.</p>
