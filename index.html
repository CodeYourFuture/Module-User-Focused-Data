			<h3>What is Git?</h3>
				<p>Git basically takes a picture of what all your files look like at that moment and stores a reference to that snapshot.</p>

			<h3>Why do developers need Git?</h3>
			<p>Git is the most commonly used version control system. Git tracks the changes you make to files, so you have a record of what has been done, and you can revert to specific versions should you ever need to. Git also makes collaboration easier, allowing changes by multiple people to all be merged into one source.</p>

			<h3>What is a branch in Git?</h3>
			<p>A branch in Git is simply a lightweight movable pointer to one of these commits. The default branch name in Git is master. As you start making commits, you're given a master branch that points to the last commit you made. Every time you commit, the master branch pointer moves forward automatically.</p>
