            Git is an open-source distributed version control system (DVCS) that helps developers manage and track
            changes in their code over time. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005, primarily to support the
            development of the Linux kernel, but it has since become the standard tool for version control in software
            development.

            Unlike traditional version control systems, which rely on a central server, Git is distributed. This means
            that every developer working on a project has a full copy of the project history stored locally on their
            computer. This design offers several advantages, such as faster operations, offline capabilities, and a more
            resilient workflow since the entire history is backed up across multiple machines.

            Git operates by taking snapshots of the project’s files at specific points in time, which are referred to as
            commits. Each commit represents a complete snapshot of the project's state at that moment, along with
            metadata like the author’s name, a timestamp, and a commit message explaining the changes.

            One of Git’s key features is its branching system. Branches allow developers to work on separate features,
            bug fixes, or experiments without affecting the main codebase. Once a branch’s work is complete, it can be
            merged back into the main branch, ensuring that collaboration is seamless and conflict-free.

            Git also provides an extensive set of tools for managing the lifecycle of a project, including commands for
            comparing versions, resolving conflicts, and rolling back changes. These features make Git not only powerful
            but also an essential tool for developers working in teams.

            In summary, Git empowers developers to collaborate efficiently, track the evolution of their projects, and
            ensure that their work is safe and organized throughout the development process.
