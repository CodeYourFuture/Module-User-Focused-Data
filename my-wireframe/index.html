            <h3>What is Git?</h3>
            <p>Git is a distributed version control system designed to track changes in source code during software
                development. Created by Linus Torvalds in 2005, Git allows multiple developers to work on a project
                simultaneously without overwriting each other's contributions. It stores data in snapshots and enables
                easy
                collaboration, branch creation, and change history tracking.</p>
